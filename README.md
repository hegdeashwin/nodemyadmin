# nodemyadmin

nodeMyAdmin is an open source software tool written in Node.js and front-end JavaScript framework, intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the Web. Frequently used operations (managing databases, tables, columns, relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc) can be performed via the user interface, while you still have the ability to directly execute any SQL statement.
